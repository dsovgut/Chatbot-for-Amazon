## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"RAG system not initialized"**
- Ensure OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Run `python setup.py --check` to verify setup

**"No processed data found"**
- Run `python setup.py --test-setup` for quick setup
- Run `python setup.py --full-setup` for complete dataset

**"CLIP model loading failed"**
- Ensure PyTorch and transformers are installed correctly
- Check GPU drivers if using CUDA

**"Evaluation failed"**
- Check OpenAI API key and credits
- Ensure processed data exists
- Try `python run_evaluation.py --quick` for limited evaluation

**"Image upload failed"**
- Ensure uploaded file is a valid image format (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Check file size (max 10MB recommended)

**"API rate limit exceeded"**
- Reduce processing batch size in `data_processor.py`
- Add delays between API calls
- Consider processing in smaller chunks

### Performance Optimization

**For faster processing:**
- Use GPU for CLIP processing (10x faster than CPU)
- Use `--test-setup` for initial testing
- Increase batch sizes if you have more RAM

**For better accuracy:**
- Process the full dataset with `--full-setup`
- Use higher resolution images (up to 512x512)
- Combine text and image queries for multimodal search

**Memory optimization:**
- Use numpy embeddings (.npy files) for faster loading
- Process dataset in chunks if memory is limited
- Close unused applications during processing

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### API Costs (OpenAI)
- **Test setup (500 products)**: ~$10-20
- **Full dataset (~10,000 products)**: ~$50-100
- **Runtime queries**: ~$0.01-0.05 per query
- **Evaluation runs**: ~$2-5 per comprehensive evaluation

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB+ recommended
